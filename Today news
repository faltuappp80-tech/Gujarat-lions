Iran Protests: Since anti-regime protests erupted and escalated into an exchange of trade between America and Iran, the first two commercial flights landed in Delhi last night. The flights were regular, not a part of the evacuation plan. However, India remain prepare for any such situation.


The Indian government earlier released an advisory, urging citizens to avoid travelling to Iran if not essential.


While the situation now appears to be returning to normal, some flights from India were impacted on January 15 after the brief closure of Iranian airspace. As soon as the Iranian airspace was reopened and flight services between India and Iran resumed, several Indians chose to return to the country.

The Indian embassy in Tehran had been in touch with Indian pilgrims, students, and businessmen for evacuation and issued an advisory for Indians in Iran. As soon as people returned to India, they thanked the Indian govt for assisting in the crisis and staying accessible.

Students Recall Situation In Iran
An MBBA, who has arrived in India, recalling the situation in Iran, said that she had heard of protests but never saw any, but the Internet was suspended in the area where she lived.

"When we went outside, protesters would come in front of the car. They would cause a little trouble. There was no internet. Therefore, we couldn't inform our families, and we were a little worried. We couldn't even contact the embassy," said an Indian national who was in Iran for a month.


Internet Access Was Major Issue
An Indian engineer who travelled to Iran for work purposes elaborated on the situation in the country, saying that the situation has improved, with network issues being the only problem he faced during his brief stay.

"People were worried, but now the scenario in Tehran is now normal. There was fire; the protests were dangerous. However, there were fewer protesters compared to those supporting the regime," said another national, thanking the government for its efforts to bring back the students.

Unrest engulfed Iran in late December after a massive protest against the Khamenei regime was handled with muscle power. Nearly 3,000 lives were lost during the violent crackdown on protestors in the last two weeks.

The situation escalated beyond the borders after Trump said that he was sending help to anti-regime protestors. The situation appears to return to normal as Trump drops his aggressive stance against Iran.

9,000 Indian nationals are currently present in Iran, hence India is observing situation closely.
